The calculate_surface function calculates the surface Green's function iteratively given the alpha and beta matrices as E.

Optional Parameters:
eta : this is the added infinitesimal parameter to ensure that we obtain the retarded Green's function, default value = 0.00001
N : max number of iterationsi, default value = 10000
eps : the accetable level of tolerance between two iterations, default value = 0.0001

Notes:
- Having a higher value of eta seems to speed up the iteration. But ideally to obtain the correct Green's function, eta must be small.

The iteration does not seem to converge for values of E above the superconducting gap.
